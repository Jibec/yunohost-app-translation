"mumble-web is an HTML5 Mumble client for use in modern browsers.  The Mumble "
"protocol uses TCP for control and UDP for voice. Running in a browser, both "
"are unavailable to this client. Instead Websockets are used for control and "
"WebRTC is used for voice (using Websockets as fallback if the server does "
"not support WebRTC)."
