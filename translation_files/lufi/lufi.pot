"Lufi stores files and allows you to download them. Is that all? No. All the "
"files are encrypted **by the browser**! It means that your files **never** "
"leave your computer unencrypted.  The administrator of the Lufi instance you "
"use will not be able to see what is in your file, neither will your network "
"administrator, or your ISP.  The encryption key part of the URL is a anchor "
"(Cf. [Fragment Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Fragment_identifier)), that means this part is only processed client-side "
"and does not reach the server. :-)"
