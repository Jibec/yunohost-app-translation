"PeerTube is a decentralized and federated video hosting software. To publish "
"videos, the user must register with a host (called an instance). Each host "
"has its own conditions of use (storage space per user, moderation rules, "
"themes, etc.). Thanks to WebTorrent, if several people view the same video, "
"fragments of it are exchanged between people so as not to overload the "
"instance. Decentralized: Each instance can follow one or more other PeerTube "
"instances in order to allow its users to view their videos. Federated: Via "
"the ActivityPub protocol, Peertube can interact with other software that is "
"part of the Fediverse, such as Mastodon for example."
