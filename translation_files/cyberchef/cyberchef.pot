"to deal with complex tools or programming languages. CyberChef encourages "
"both technical and non-technical people to explore data formats, encryption "
"and compression: encode, decode, format data, parse data, encrypt, decrypt, "
"compress data, extract data, perform arithmetic functions against data, "
"etc.. There are around 300 operations in CyberChef allowing you to carry out "
"simple and complex tasks easily."
