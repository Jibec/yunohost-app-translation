"\"Firefox Sync\" is a browser synchronization feature available in Firefox. "
"It allows to synchronize bookmarks, browsing history, preferences, "
"passwords, filled forms, add-ons, and the last opened tabs across multiple "
"computers. This traditionally relies on Mozilla's synchronization servers "
"(though data are encrypted). Using this app, you can synchronize your "
"Firefox instances using your own synchronization server."
