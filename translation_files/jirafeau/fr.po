"Jirafeau offers the possibility to host and share your files with ease. "
"Choose a file, Jirafeau will provide you with a link with many options. It "
"is possible to protect your links with a password as well as to choose how "
"long the file will be kept on the server. The file and the link will self-"
"destruct after this time. Downloads of transmitted files can be limited to a "
"certain date, and each file can self-destruct after the first download. "
"Jirafeau allows you to configure maximum retention times and maximum size "
"per file. Encryption is available as an option."
