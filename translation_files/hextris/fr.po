"HEXTRIS is a fast paced puzzle game inspired by Tetris.  Blocks start on the "
"edges of the screen, and fall towards the inner blue hexagon.  The objective "
"of the game is to prevent the blocks from stacking outside the area of the "
"grey hexagon.  To do this, you must rotate the hexagon to manage different "
"stacks of blocks on each face.  Aim to connect 3 or more blocks of the same "
"color: when 3 or more blocks of the same color touch each other, they are "
"destroyed, and the blocks above them slide down! Destroying multiple series "
"of blocks grants combos, whose durations are indicated by a quickly receding "
"outline around the outer, grey hexagon.  You lose once blocks on a face of "
"the hexagon stack outside of the outer hexagon!"
