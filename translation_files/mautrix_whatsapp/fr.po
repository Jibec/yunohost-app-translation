"## Configuration of the bridge The bridge is [roughly configured at "
"installation](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mautrix_whatsapp_ynh/blob/"
"master/conf/config.yaml), e.g. allowed admin and user of the bot.  Finer "
"configuration can be done by using the existing config panel in the Yunohost "
"admin panel or by modifying the following configuration file with SSH: ```/"

"Rooms & Encryption Settings`. If you enable `Allow Encryption between Matrix "
"Client and Bridge Server?`, the bridge won't enable encryption on its own, "
"but will work in encrypted rooms.  Alternatively two more options will "
"appear, `Force-enable Encryption in all Portal Rooms the Bridge creates?` "
"which will automatically enable encryption in new portals and `Require "
"encryption?` which will enforce encryption on any of the messages that you "
"send (this will make the bridge drop any future unencrypted messages)."

"A puppeting bridge between Matrix and WhatsApp packaged as a YunoHost "
"service.  Messages, media and notifications are bridged between a WhatsApp "
"user and a matrix user.  With the RelayBot login option, the matrix user can "
"invite other matrix user in a bridged WhatsApp room, such that even people "
"without a WhatsApp account can participate to WhatsApp group conversations.  "
"The [\"Mautrix-WhatsApp\"](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/whatsapp/index."

"(mysql also available).  Therefore, [Synapse for YunoHost](https://github."
