"Dagu is a powerful Cron alternative that comes with a Web UI. It allows you "
"to define dependencies between commands as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in "
"a declarative YAML format. Dagu simplifies the management and execution of "
"complex workflows. It natively supports running Docker containers, making "
"HTTP requests, and executing commands over SSH."
