"All your e-mail, from all your accounts, in one place. Cypht is not your "
"father's webmail. Unless you are one of my daughters, in which case it is "
"your father's webmail. Cypht is like a news reader, but for e-mail. Cypht "
"does not replace your existing accounts - it combines them into one. And "
"it's also a news reader."

"Cypht is an application built entirely of plugins, or as we call them, "
"module sets (which is obviously way cooler sounding than plugins), that are "
"executed by the framework. Modules provide a flexible way to add new "
"features or customize the program without hacking the code."
