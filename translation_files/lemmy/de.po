"Lemmy is similar to sites like Reddit, Lobste.rs, or Hacker News: you "
"subscribe to forums you're interested in, post links and discussions, then "
"vote, and comment on them. Behind the scenes, it is very different; anyone "
"can easily run a server, and all these servers are federated (think email), "
"and connected to the same universe, called the Fediverse."
