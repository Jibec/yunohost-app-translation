"AutoBD makes it easy to create a comic strip and export it as an image. It "
"comes with a collection of freely licensed backgrounds and characters, but "
"you can use your own content from your computer’s storage. The application "
"makes it easy to give credit by automatically adding the appropriate mention "
"as you use the provided drawings. This makes it easier to respect copyright "
"and raises awareness among students."
