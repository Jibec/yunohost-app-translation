"The bridge can optionally encrypt messages between Matrix users and the "

"recommended when using end-to-bridge encryption.  If you want to enable it, "
"look for the option ```bridge: encryption``` in the config file. If you only "
"set ```allow: true```, the bridge won't enable encryption on its own, but "
"will work in encrypted rooms. If you set ```default: true```, the bridge "
"will automatically enable encryption in new portals."

"A puppeting bridge between Matrix and Telegram packaged as a YunoHost "
"service. Messages, notifications (and sometimes media) are bridged between a "
"Telegram user and a Matrix user. Currently the Matrix user can NOT invite "
"other Matrix user in a bridged Telegram room, so only someone with a "
"Telegram account can participate to Telegram group conversations. The "
"[\"Mautrix-Telegram\"](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/telegram/index."
"html) bridge is a Synapse App Service and relies on postgresql. Therefore, "
"[Synapse for YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/synapse_ynh) should "
"be installed beforehand."
