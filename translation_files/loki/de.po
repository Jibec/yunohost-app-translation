"Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log "
"aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost "
"effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, "
"but rather a set of labels for each log stream."

"A Loki-based logging stack consists of 3 components: - Promtail (included in "
"this package) is the agent, responsible for gathering logs and sending them "
"to Loki.  - Loki is the main server, responsible for storing logs and "
"processing queries.  - [Grafana](https://github.com/Yunohost-Apps/"
"grafana_ynh) for querying and displaying the logs."
