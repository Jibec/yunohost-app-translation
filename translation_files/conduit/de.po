"Conduit is a lightweight open-source server implementation of the Matrix "
"Specification with a focus on easy setup and low system requirements. That "
"means you can make your own Conduit setup in just a few minutes.  Conduit "
"keeps things simple, it's a single binary with an embedded database and can "
"be much faster than other server implementations in some cases."
