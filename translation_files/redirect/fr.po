"There two typical use cases are covered: - **basic, explicit redirection** : "
"this is a \"virtual\" app tile that just redirects to another url or "
"external website using HTTP code 302 - **reverse-proxy** : create an app "

"you manually installed (with or without Docker) locally or on another "
"machine."
