"Glowing Bear is a web frontend for the WeeChat IRC client and strives to be "
"a modern interface. It relies on WeeChat to do all the heavy lifting and "
"then provides some nice features on top of that, like embedding images, "
"videos, and other content. The best part, however, is that you can use it "
"from any modern internet device -- whether it's a computer, tablet, or smart "
"phone -- and all your stuff is there, wherever you are. You don't have to "
"deal with the messy technical details, and all you need to have installed is "
"a browser or our app."
