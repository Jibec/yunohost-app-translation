"Acropolis was forked from diaspora* in August 2021. The idea for the fork is "
"to optimize toward community, that is making it as easy as possible to "
"contribute. We're following a protocol that basically says if you are "
"addressing a valid problem, your code gets merged. Everything else follows "
"from that."
