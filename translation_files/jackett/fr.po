"Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps (Sonarr, "
"Radarr, SickRage, CouchPotato, Mylar3, Lidarr, DuckieTV, qBittorrent, "
"Nefarious etc.) into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html or "
"json response, and then sends results back to the requesting software. This "
"allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. "
"Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping & translation "
"logic - removing the burden from other apps."
