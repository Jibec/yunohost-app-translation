"DokuWiki is a simple to use and highly versatile Open Source wiki software "
"that doesn't require a database. It is loved by users for its clean and "
"readable syntax. The ease of maintenance, backup and integration makes it an "
"administrator's favorite. Built in access controls and authentication "
"connectors make DokuWiki especially useful in the enterprise context and the "
"large number of plugins contributed by its vibrant community allow for a "
"broad range of use cases beyond a traditional wiki."
