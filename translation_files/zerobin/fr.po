"This is a fork of ZeroBin, originally developed by SÃ©bastien Sauvage. It was "
"refactored to allow easier and cleaner extensions and has now much more "
"features than the original. It is however still fully compatible to the "
"original ZeroBin 0.19 data storage scheme. Therefore such installations can "
"be upgraded to this fork without loosing any data."
