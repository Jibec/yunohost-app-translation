"By default all data you create with dato is stored only in your browser. "
"Users can manually enable per-database synchronization with any remote couch "
"server, but this process is not obvious to users. Therefore dato provide an "
"autosynchronization mechanism.  To enable it, you need to setup a couchdb "
"server (you can do this using the [couchdb yunohost package](https://github."
"com/YunoHost-Apps/couchdb_ynh)). You should do this before installing dato.  "
"Then when installing dato, set the url to your couchdb server when prompted "
"(you will also need to fill your couchdb admin password, and info about the "
"dato admin user to create). Dato will automatically setup the dato "
"administrator account in your couchdb server. You can then easily add users "
"from the user interface, as specified below."

"If you setup autosynchronization, users will need an account to use the app. "
"Dato doesn't support LDAP for the moment, so you will need to add users in "

"g. https://dato.yourdomain.tld/users/), create a new user, then don't forget "
"to click on \"roles\" under the user's name, and add the role `dato`.  If "
"you want a user to have administration rights (= to have the power to add/"
"remove users) you can give that user the `dato-admin` role."

"Please be aware that dato is a Progressive Web App. In a nutshell, this "
"means that browsers cache the whole app, so it doesn't have to be requested "
"to the server every time a user is visiting it.  This lowers solicitation of "
"the server, and also allow users to use dato offline."

"When the app is upgraded, the user's browser will automatically detect that "
"there is a new version, and propose to reload the page to update. However, "
"sometimes it seems a bit random how browsers notice the new version, so if "
"you want to make sure you're using the latest version, click on the \"?\" "
"button (top-right in the web interface), and choose \"credits\" to verify "
"the version you're using.  You can also force reloading the app from the "
"server opening \"about:serviceworkers\" in your browser and unregistering "
"the worker for the domain in which you installed dato."
