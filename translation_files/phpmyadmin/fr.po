"phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the "
"administration of MySQL over the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of "
"operations on MySQL and MariaDB. Frequently used operations (managing "
"databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can "
"be performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to "
"directly execute any SQL statement."
