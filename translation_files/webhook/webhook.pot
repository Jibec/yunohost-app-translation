"Webhook is a lightweight configurable tool written in Go, that allows you to "
"easily create HTTP endpoints (hooks) on your server, which you can use to "
"execute configured commands. You can also pass data from the HTTP request "
"(such as headers, payload or query variables) to your commands. Webhook also "
"allows you to specify rules which have to be satisfied in order for the hook "
"to be triggered."
