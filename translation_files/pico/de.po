"Pico is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS. That’s definitely a "
"mouthful, what does it even mean? In the most basic sense, it means that "
"there is no administration backend or database to deal with. You simply "
"create markdown files in the content folder and those files become your "
"pages. There’s much more to Pico than that though."
