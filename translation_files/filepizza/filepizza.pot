"Using WebRTC, FilePizza eliminates the initial upload step required by other "
"web-based file sharing services. When senders initialize a transfer, they "
"receive a \"tempalink\" they can distribute to recipients. Upon visiting "
"this link, recipients' browsers connect directly to the senderâ€™s browser and "
"may begin downloading the selected file. Because data is never stored in an "
"intermediary server, the transfer is fast, private, and secure."
