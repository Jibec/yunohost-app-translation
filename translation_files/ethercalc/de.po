"EtherCalc is a collaborative spreadsheet that can be edited in real time. "
"Each spreadsheet has its own URL. It has the basic functionalities: "
"formatting, mathematical functions, graphics, adding comments, version "
"history, export in HTML or in CSV. EtherCalc is a decentralized software: "
"different instances allow the use of the service, they are made available by "
"several organizations (for example the eponymous site or the FramaCalc "
"service). This makes it possible to avoid concentrating all the data in the "
"hands of the same actor. Instances can be personalized (limitation of the "
"duration of hosting of the spreadsheet, modification of the design, etc.)."
