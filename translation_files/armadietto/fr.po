"> #### **Storage security**\n"
">\n"
"> In production, we recommend that you restrict access to the files managed by your armadietto server as much as possible. This is particularly true if you host your storage on a machine with other web applications; you need to protect your files in the event that one of those apps is exploited.\n"
">\n"
"> You should take these steps to keep your storage safe:\n"
">\n"
">    - Pick a unique Unix user to run your server process; no other process on the box should run as this user: sudo useradd armadietto --system --no-create-home\n"
">\n"
">    - Do not run other applications as root, or as any user that could access files owned by your armadietto user\n"
">\n"
">    - Make sure the directory path/to/storage cannot be read, written or executed by anyone but this user: sudo chmod 0700 /path/to/storage && sudo chown armadietto /path/to/storage\n"
">\n"
">    - Do not run armadietto as root; if you need to bind to port 80 or 443 use a reverse proxy like nginx, Apache2, caddy, lighttpd or enable bind capability: setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' `which armadietto`\n"
">\n"
">    - Ideally, run your storage inside a container or on a dedicated machine\n"
