"Huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you "
"online. They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions on your "
"behalf. Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along a "
"directed graph. Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your "
"own server. You always know who has your data. You do."
